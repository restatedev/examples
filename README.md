# Restate examples

A collection of examples that illustrate how to use Restate to solve common application
challenges.

* **[Use Cases and Patterns](patterns-use-cases):** Small specific use cases, like webhooks,
  workflows, asynchronous task queuing.

* **[Basics](basics):** Small examples highlighting the basic building blocks, like
  durable execution or virtual objects.

* **[End-to-End Applications](end-to-end-applications):** Runnable demo applications that consist
  of many components, e.g., a fodo ordering app, or an e-commerce site.
  Typically packaged as a docker compose setup.

* **[Tutorials](tutorials):** A step-by-step guide that builds an application and introduces
  the Restate concepts on the way.

* **[Templates](templates):** Project templates for various languages and build systems.
  Simple 'Hello World!' examples in a proper build setup that you can use if you want to start
  a brand new project for a service or lambda that will be invoked through Restate.

## Running the examples

Some examples are just illustrations of code, but many are runnable. Their READMEs generally explain
how to get them running. Here are the general steps:

### (1) Starting the Restate Server

Examples that run individually typically need a running Restate Server instance.
Some examples can be run with Docker Compose. Those already bring their own Restate server instance.

You can launch Restate in a number of ways, including using the [Restate Cloud](https://restate.dev/get-restate-cloud/)
service. See [Get Restate](https://restate.dev/get-restate/) for all options to run Restate. Here is a short-list
of options to run Restate Server locally.

Install and run the `restate-server` binary:
  - Download from https://github.com/restatedev/restate/releases
  - Install with Homebrew: `brew install restatedev/tap/restate-server`
  - Install with _npm_: `npm install --global @restatedev/restate-server@latest`
  - Run in Docker: `docker run --name restate_dev --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 9070:9070 -p 9071:9071 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway docker.io/restatedev/restate:latest`


### (2) Register the examples at Restate Server

The service endpoints need to be registered in Restate, so that Restate will proxy their function calls and
do its magic. Once both server and example are running, register the example:

* Via the [CLI](https://docs.restate.dev/operate/cli): `restate deployments register localhost:9080`
* Via `curl localhost:9070/deployments -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080"}'`

**Important** When running Restate with Docker, use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` in the URIs above.

## Adding Examples and Releasing (for Restate developers/contributors)

When adding a new example:

* Make sure it has a README
* Add it to this README
* Check it's listed in run tests/update examples scripts in [`.tools`](./.tools)
* Optionally, add it to the [zips script](./.tools/prepare_release_zip.sh) and [`release.yaml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml)

**Creating a Release**

Before releasing, trigger the "pre-release" workflow to update sdk versions. This automatically creates a pull request, which must be manually merged.

Once the repo is ready for the release, push a tag of the form `vX.Y.Z`:

```shell
git checkout main
git tag -m "Examples v0.9.1" v0.9.1
git push origin v0.9.1
```

This triggers a workflow that [creates a draft release](https://github.com/restatedev/examples/releases) on Github, which you need to approve to finalize it.

Please update the version tag referenced on the [Tour of Restate](https://github.com/restatedev/documentation/blob/main/docs/tour.mdx) documentation page.
