# Virtual Objects hold state and have methods to interact with the object.
# An object is identified by a unique id - only one object exists per id.
#
# Virtual Objects have their state locally accessible without requiring any database
# connection or lookup. State is exclusive, and atomically committed with the
# method execution.
#
# Virtual Objects are _Stateful Serverless_ constructs.
