// This is an example of the benefits of Durable Execution.
// Durable Execution ensures code runs to the end, even in the presence of
// failures. This is particularly useful for code that updates different systems and needs to
// make sure all updates are applied:
//
//  - Failures are automatically retried, unless they are explicitly labeled
//    as terminal errors
//  - Restate tracks execution progress in a journal.
//    Work that has already been completed is not repeated during retries.
//    Instead, the previously completed journal entries are replayed.
//    This ensures that stable deterministic values are used during execution.
//  - Durable executed functions use the regular code and control flow,
//    no custom DSLs
//

async function applyRoleUpdate(ctx: restate.Context, update: UpdateRequest) {
  // parameters are durable across retries
  const { userId, role, permissions } = update;

  // Apply a change to one system (e.g., DB upsert, API call, ...).
  // The side effect persists the result with a consensus method so
  // any later code relies on a deterministic result.
  const success = await ctx.run(() => applyUserRole(userId, role));
  if (!success) {
    return;
  }

  // Loop over the permission settings and apply them.
  // Each operation through the Restate context is journaled
  // and recovery restores results of previous operations from the journal
  // without re-executing them.
  for (const permission of permissions) {
    await ctx.run(() => applyPermission(userId, permission));
  }

// When invoking this function (see below for sample request), it will apply all
// role and permission changes, regardless of crashes.
// You will see all lines of the type "Applied permission remove:allow for user Sam Beckett"
// in the log, across all retries. You will also see that re-tries will not re-execute
// previously completed actions again, so each line occurs only once.
