# Examples of the basic concepts for Restate in TypeScript / JavaScript

The examples here showcase the most basic building blocks of Restate. **Durable Execution**,
**Durable Promises**, and **Virtual Objects**, and the **Workflows** abstraction built on top
of them.

The individual example files contain code snippets with comments and a brief descriptions
about how they work and how they can be run.  

### Examples

* **[Basic Durable Execution:](src/1_durable_execution.ts):** Running code cleanly
  to the end in the presence of failures. Automatic retries and recovery of previously
  finished actions. The example applies a series of updates and permission setting changes
  to user's profile.

* **[Durable Execution with Compensations](src/2_durable_execution_compensation.ts):**
  Reliably compensating / undoing previous actions upon unrecoverable errors halfway
  through multi-step change. This is the same example as above, extended for cases where
  a part of the change cannot be applied (conflict) and everything has to roll back.

* **[Workflows](src/3_workflows.ts):** Workflows are durable execution tasks that can
  be submitted and awaited. They have an identity and can be signaled and queried
  through durable promises. The example is a user-signup flow that takes multiple
  operations, including verifying the email address. 

* **[Virtual Objects](src/4_virtual_objects.ts):** Stateful serverless objects
  to manage durable consistent state and state-manipulating logic.

* **[Kafka Event-processing](src/5_events_processing.ts):** Processing events to
  update various downstream systems with durable event handlers, event-delaying,
  in a strict-per-key order.

* **[Stateful Event-processing](src/6_events_state.ts):** Populating state from
  events and making is queryable via RPC handlers.


### Running the examples

1. Make sure you have installed the dependencies: `npm install`.

2. Start Restate Server in a separate shell: `npx restate-server`

3. Start the relevant example, i.e., `npm run example-1` for the first example.

4. Register the example at Restate server by calling
   `npx restate -y deployment register --force "localhost:9080"`.

   _Note: the '--force' flag here is to circumvent all checks related to graceful upgrades, because it is only a playground, not a production setup._

5. Check the comments in the example for how to interact with the example.

**NOTE:** When you get an error of the type `{"code":"not_found","message":"Service 'greeter' not found. ...}`, then you forgot step (4) for that example.
