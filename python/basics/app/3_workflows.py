"""
Workflow are a special type of Virtual Object with a run handler that runs once per ID.
Workflows are stateful and can be interacted with via queries (getting data out of the workflow)
and signals (pushing data to the workflow).

Workflows are used to model long-running flows, such as user onboarding, order processing, etc.
Workflows have the following handlers:
 - Main workflow in run() method
 - Additional methods interact with the workflow.
Each workflow instance has a unique ID and runs only once (to success or failure).
