"""
Trip reservation workflow using sagas:
Restate infinitely retries failures, and recovers previous progress.
But for some types of failures (terminal errors), we don't want to retry but want to undo the previous actions and finish.

Restate guarantees the execution of your code. This makes it very easy to implement sagas.
We execute actions, and keep track of a list of undo actions.
When a terminal errors occurs, Restate ensures execution of all compensations.

+------ Initialize compensations list ------+

| 2. Reserve Car & Register Undo            |
| 3. Generate Payment ID & Register Refund  |

| 5. Confirm Flight Reservation             |
| 6. Confirm Car Reservation                |
+------------------ Except ------------------+
| If TerminalError:                         |
|   Execute compensations in reverse order  |
| Rethrow error                             |

Note: that the compensation logic is purely implemented in user code (no special Restate API)
