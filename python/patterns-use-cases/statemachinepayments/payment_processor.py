# per payment-id. Requests are queued and processed sequentially per id.
# Methods can be called multiple times with the same payment-id, but payment will be executed
# only once. If a 'cancelPayment' is called for an id, the payment will either be undone, or
# blocked from being made in the future, depending on whether the cancel call comes before or after
# the 'makePayment' call.
