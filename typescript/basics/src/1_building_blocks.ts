/*
* RESTATE's DURABLE BUILDING BLOCKS
*
* Restate turns familiar programming constructs into recoverable, distributed building blocks.
* They get persisted in Restate, survive failures, and can be revived on another process.
*
* No more need for retry/recovery logic, K/V stores, workflow orchestrators,
* scheduler services, message queues, ...
*
* The run handler below shows a catalog of these building blocks.
* Look at the other examples in this project to see how to use them in examples.

const myService = restate.service({
    name: "myService",

        // This handler can be called over HTTP at http://restate:8080/myService/handlerName

            // 1. IDEMPOTENCY: Add an idempotency key to the header of your requests
            // Restate deduplicates calls automatically. Nothing to do here.

            // ---
            // 2. DURABLE RPC: Call other services without manual retry and deduplication logic
            // Restate persists all requests and ensures execution till completion
            const result = await ctx.objectClient(SubscriptionService, "my-sub-123").create("my-request");

            // ---
            // 3. DURABLE MESSAGING: send (delayed) messages to other services without deploying a message broker
            // Restate persists the timers and triggers execution
            ctx.objectSendClient(SubscriptionService, "my-sub-123").create("my-request");

            // ---
            // 4. DURABLE PROMISES: tracked by Restate, can be moved between processes and survive failures
            // Awakeables: block the workflow until notified by another handler
            const {id, promise} = ctx.awakeable()
            // Wait on the promise
            // If the process crashes while waiting, Restate will recover the promise somewhere else
            await promise;
            // Another process can resolve the awakeable via its ID
            ctx.resolveAwakeable(id);

            // ---
            // 5. DURABLE TIMERS: sleep or wait for a timeout, tracked by Restate and recoverable
            // When this runs on FaaS, the handler suspends and the timer is tracked by Restate
            // Example of durable recoverable sleep
            // If the service crashes two seconds later, Restate will invoke it after another 3 seconds
            await ctx.sleep(5000)
            // Example of waiting on a promise (call/awakeable/...) or a timeout
            await promise.orTimeout(5000);
            // Example of scheduling a handler for later on

            // 7. PERSIST RESULTS: avoid re-execution of actions on retries
            // Use this for non-deterministic actions or interaction with APIs, DBs, ...
            // For example, generate idempotency keys that are stable across retries
            // Then use these to call other APIs and let them deduplicate
