//
//  An example of a trip reservation workflow, using the SAGAs pattern to
//  undo previous steps in case of an error.
//
//  The durable execution's guarantee to run code to the end in the presence
//  of failures, and to deterministically recover previous steps from the
//  journal, makes SAGAs easy.
//  Every step pushes a compensation action (an undo operation) to a stack.
//  in the case of an error, those operations are run.
//
//  The main requirement is that steps are implemented as journald
//  operations, like `ctx.run()` or rpc/messaging.
