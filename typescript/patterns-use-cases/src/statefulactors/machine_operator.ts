// This is a State Machine implemented with a Virtual Object
//
// - The object holds the state of the state machine and defines the methods
//   to transition between the states.
// - The object's unique id identifies the state machine. Many parallel state
//   machines exist, but only state machine (object) exists per id.
// - The "single-writer-per-key" characteristic of virtual objects ensures
//   that one state transition per state machine is in progress at a time.
//   Additional transitions are enqueued for that object, while a transition
//   for a machine is still in progress.
