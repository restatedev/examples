// The standalone Durable Promises here work like regular futures/promises
// but are durable cross process and failures.

// ensures code runs to the end, even in the presence of
// failures. Use this for code that updates different systems and needs to
// make sure all updates are applied.
//
//  - Failures are automatically retried, unless they are explicitly labeled
//    as terminal errors
//  - Restate journals execution progress. Re-tries use that journal to replay
//    previously completed results, avoiding a repetition of that work and
//    ensuring stable deterministic values are used during execution.
//  - Durable executed functions use the regular code and control flow,
//    no custom DSLs
