/**
 * Example 2-phase-commit integration library for Restate and PostegreSQL.
 * 
 * This uses PostgreSQL's PREPARE TRANSACTION feature to ensure that Restate
 * kicks off a transaction once and only once.
 * 
 * Postgres' interface is far from optimal here, for example it does not provide a way
 * to block/fence off discarded transaction IDs or establish other relationship between
 * transaction IDs. As a result, this code is needs to be very aggressive in cleaning
 * up previous transactions, to avoid leaving database locks in place.  
 * 
 * This code currently works only on services which have a bidi streaming connection !!!
