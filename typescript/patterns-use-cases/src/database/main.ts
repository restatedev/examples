//  This example shows various patterns to access databases from Restate
//  handlers.
//
//  The basics are:
//
//  (1) You don't need to do anything special, you can just interact with
//      your database the same way as from other microservices or
//      workflow activities.
//
//  (2) But you can use Restate's state, journal, and concurrency mechanisms
//      as helpers to improve common access problems, solve race conditions,
//      or avoid inconsistencies in the presence of retries, concurrent requests,
//      or zombie processes.
//
// The below example illustrate this step by step.
//

}
