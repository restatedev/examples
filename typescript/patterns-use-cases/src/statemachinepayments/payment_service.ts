 * processed sequentially per id).

 * Methods can be called multiple times with the same payment-id, but payment
 * will be executed only once. If a cancellation is triggered for that
 * token, the payment will not happen or be undone, regardless of whether
 * the cancel call comes before or after the payment call.
