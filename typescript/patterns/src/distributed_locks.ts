// Distributed locks are a powerful primitive that ensures shared resources are
// not accessed in parallel by multiple callers.
//
// Restate itself has great support to run code with exclusive access to some
// logical resources via keyed services (see the "single writer concurrency" pattern).
//
// But if actual distributed locks are required, it is fairly easy to create a
// robust implementation with Restate, as shown in this pattern.
