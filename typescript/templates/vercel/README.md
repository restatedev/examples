# 🚀 Restate + Vercel Template

Welcome to the **Restate TypeScript + Vercel** template! ✨

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- 📦 Node runtime installed
- 🔧 npm or yarn package manager
- 🌐 Vercel account (for deployment)

## 🛠️ Local Development

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Launch the local Restate server:
```bash
npx @restatedev/restate-server
```

Start Next.js locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Connect your local service to Restate:
```bash
npx @restatedev/restate dep add --use-http1.1 http://localhost:3000/restate
```

Iterate! 🔧

## 🚀 Deploy

### 📦 On Restate Cloud

This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow setup for automated deployment. To set up:

* Create the project importing this repository: https://vercel.com/new
* Disable [Vercel Authentication](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication) for the project.
![Screenshot of Vercel authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/docs-restate/refs/heads/main/docs/img/services/deploy/vercel-disable-authentication.png)
* Add the following to **Github Actions repository secrets**:
  - `RESTATE_ADMIN_URL`: The Admin URL. You can find it in [Developers > Admin URL](https://cloud.restate.dev/to/developers/integration#admin)
  - `RESTATE_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Restate Cloud auth token. To get one, go to [Developers > API Keys > Create API Key](https://cloud.restate.dev?createApiKey=true&createApiKeyDescription=deployment-key&createApiKeyRole=rst:role::AdminAccess), and make sure to select **Admin** for role

Once the repo is set up, **just push to the main branch**, Vercel will deploy and promote the `main` branch, and the action configured in [deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) will automatically register the deployment to Restate.

### 🔧 Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually by following the [Restate + Vercel documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/services/deploy/vercel).

## 🎮 Test Your Service

Once deployed, you can test your service using the [Restate Playground](https://cloud.restate.dev/to/overview?servicePlayground=Greeter#/operations/greet).
