# 🚀 Restate + Cloudflare Workers Template

Welcome to the **Restate TypeScript + Cloudflare Workers** template! ✨

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- 📦 Node.js 20+ installed
- 🔧 npm or yarn package manager
- 🌐 Cloudflare account (for deployment)

## 🛠️ Local Development

Launch the local Restate server:
```bash
npx @restatedev/restate-server
```

Start the Cloudflare Workers development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Connect your local service to Restate:
```bash
npx @restatedev/restate dep add http://localhost:9080 --use-http1.1
```

> 💡 **Note**: The `--use-http1.1` flag is required **only** when running locally.

Iterate! 🔧

## 🚀 Deploy

### 📦 On Restate Cloud

This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow setup for automated deployment.

To set up the repository, add the following secrets:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token. To get a token, check https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/github-actions/
- `RESTATE_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Restate Cloud auth token. To get one, go to [Developers > API Keys > Create API Key](https://cloud.restate.dev?createApiKey=true&createApiKeyDescription=deployment-key&createApiKeyRole=rst:role::AdminAccess), and make sure to select **Admin** for role
- `RESTATE_ADMIN_URL`: The Admin URL. You can find that out in Developers > Invoke. For example: `https://some-environment-private-id.env.us.restate.cloud:9070`

Once the repo is set up, **just push to the main branch** and you'll get your services updated.

Check the [workflow deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) for more details.
