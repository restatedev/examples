# XState + Restate for TypeScript

[XState](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate) is a state management and orchestration solution for JavaScript and TypeScript apps.

Restate and XState can be used together to create resilient and durable state machines that can be run in a distributed environment.

Have a look at the [restatedev/xstate repo](https://github.com/restatedev/xstate) for information and examples.
