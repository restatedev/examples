### Food Ordering App

The [Food Order App](food-ordering) implements a food delivery service (like DoorDash) that
manages orders, restaurants, payments, and delivery drivers.

The example mixes workflows (ordering) and stateful microservices (driver management),
and uses Kafka as an event source for updates from delivery drivers.
