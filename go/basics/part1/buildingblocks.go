 * RESTATE's DURABLE BUILDING BLOCKS
 *
 * Restate turns familiar programming constructs into recoverable, distributed building blocks.
 * They get persisted in Restate, survive failures, and can be revived on another process.
 *
 * No more need for retry/recovery logic, K/V stores, workflow orchestrators,
 * scheduler services, message queues, ...
 *
 * The run handler below shows a catalog of these building blocks.
 * Look at the other examples in this project to see how to use them in examples.

	// 2. DURABLE RPC: Call other services without manual retry and deduplication logic
	// Restate persists all requests and ensures execution till completion

		Request(SubscriptionRequest{UserID: "123"})

	// When this runs on FaaS, the handler suspends and the timer is tracked by Restate
	// Example of durable recoverable sleep
	// If the service crashes two seconds later, Restate will invoke it after another 3 seconds
