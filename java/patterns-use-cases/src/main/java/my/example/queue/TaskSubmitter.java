 * Restate is as a sophisticated task queue, with extra features like:
 * - delaying execution and reliable timers
 * - stateful tasks
 * - queues per key (>< per partition; slow tasks for a key don't block others)
 * - retries and recovery upon failures
 *
 * Every handler in Restate is executed asynchronously and can be treated
 * as a reliable asynchronous task.
